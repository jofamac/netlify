abstract: Understanding effects of emotional valence and stress on children’s
  memory is important for educational and legal contexts. This study
  disentangled the effects of emotional content of to-be- remembered information
  (i.e., items differing in emotional valence and arousal), stress exposure, and
  associated cortisol secretion on children’s memory. We also examined whether
  girls’ memory is more affected by stress induction. A total of 143 6- and
  7-year- old children were randomly allocated to the Trier Social Stress Test
  for Children (n = 103) or a control condition (n = 40). At 25 min after
  stressor onset, children incidentally encoded 75 objects varying in emotional
  valence (crossed with arousal) together with neutral scene backgrounds. We
  found that response bias corrected memory was worse for low-arousing negative
  items than for neutral and positive items, with the latter two categories not
  being different from each other. Whereas boys’ memory was largely unaffected
  by stress, girls in the stress condition showed worse memory for negative
  items, especially the low-arousing ones, than girls in the control condition.
  Girls, compared with boys, reported higher subjective stress increases
  following stress expo- sure and had higher cortisol stress responses. Whereas
  a higher cortisol stress response was associated with better emotional memory
  in girls in the stress condition, boys’ memory was not associated with their
  cortisol secretion. Taken together, our study suggests that 6- and 7-year-old
  children, more so girls, show memory suppression for negative information.
  Girls’ memory for negative information, compared with that of boys, is also
  more strongly modulated by stress experience and the associated cortisol
  response.
