abstract: Despite common notion that the correlation of socioeconomic status
  with child cognitive performance may be driven by both environmentally– and
  genetically–mediated transactional pathways, there is a lack of longitu- dinal
  and genetically informed research that examines these postulated associations.
  The present study addresses whether family income predicts associative memory
  growth and hippocampal development in middle childhood and tests whether these
  associations persist when controlling for DNA–based polygenic scores of
  educational attainment. Participants were 142 6–to–7–year–old children, of
  which 127 returned when they were 8–to–9 years old. Longitudinal analyses
  indicated that the association of family income with children’s memory
  performance and hippocampal volume remained stable over this age range and did
  not predict change. On average, children from economically disadvantaged
  background showed lower memory performance and had a smaller hippocampal
  volume. There was no evidence to suggest that differences in memory
  performance were mediated by differences in hippocampal volume. Further
  exploratory results suggested that the relationship of income with hippocampal
  volume and memory in middle childhood is not primarily driven by genetic
  variance captured by polygenic scores of educational attainment, despite the
  fact that polygenic scores significantly predicted family income.
